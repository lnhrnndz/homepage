# Homepage

My homepage consists of multiple homepages with different links.

The [main homepage](lnhrnndz.github.io/homepage) is a fork of [smvd's homepage](https://github.com/smvd/HomePage).
If you are only interested in the periodic table homepage and none of the others, then check out [my fork](https://github.com/lnhrnndz/periodic-homepage).

Currently, the only other page is a work in progress for links I need for university, but I plan on expanding on it.
